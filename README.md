# Smart Sprint Companion – Backend

This repository contains the backend service for **Smart Sprint Companion**,  
an AI-assisted mobile application designed to support sprint planning and team focus.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Fastify
- REST API architecture

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a lightweight, modular backend that:
- Provides sprint and task-related APIs
- Supports AI-assisted decision making (as a support layer, not a core dependency)
- Can be consumed by multiple clients (mobile / web)

## Architecture Philosophy
- Backend is designed as an independent service
- Clients consume the API via HTTP
- AI is used as a decision-support tool, not as a replacement for business logic

## Current Status
🚧 Initial setup and Fastify lifecycle exploration
